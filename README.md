# 🎬 Movies Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Movies Data Analysis Project** focuses on exploring, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset containing **more than 9,000 movies**.  
The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset using **Python data analysis and visualization libraries**.

This project demonstrates a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow, starting from raw data cleaning to insightful visualizations that help understand trends, patterns, and relationships within movie data.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Load the dataset using Pandas
- Inspect dataset structure, shape, and column types

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values (nulls)
- Remove duplicates
- Convert data types where necessary
- Standardize column names

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Distribution of movie ratings and revenues
- Genre-wise analysis
- Year-wise movie release trends
- Correlation analysis between numerical features

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization
- Histograms for distributions
- Bar charts for categorical comparisons
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis
- Box plots for outlier detection
